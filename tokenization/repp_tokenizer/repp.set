;; REPP tokenization builds on a collection of rule sets, each in a file of its
;; own.  these are called modules (or at times just REPPs), and all are loaded
;; into the processor.  a specific configuration is then obtained by picking
;; one REPP module as the top-level entry point, and determining which named
;; group calls (to other modules) should be allowed, if called.  the following
;; is the global set of available modules.

;; REPP modules can be parameterized in terms of external named groups, which
;; conceptually resemble sub-routines and can be activated or deactivated; the
;; following is the default list of groups to activate (and may be overwritten
;; in individual REPP configurations).
