<TAG1><TAG2>English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca.[4][5] Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes <TAG3> that migrated to the area of Great Britain that would later take their name, England, both names ultimately deriving from the Anglia peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is closely <TAG3>related to the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other<TAG3> Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), and to a greater extent Latin and French.[6]<TAG4> <TAG5>
