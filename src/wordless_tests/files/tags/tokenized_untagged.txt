English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca . Named after the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that would later take their name , England , both names ultimately deriving from the Anglia peninsula in the Baltic Sea . It is closely related to the Frisian languages , but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages , particularly Norse ( a North Germanic language ) , and to a greater extent Latin and French .
