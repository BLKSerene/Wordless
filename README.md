For a detailed changelog, please see [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md).

Release|Remarks
-------|-------
[Latest Release for Windows](https://github.com/BLKSerene/Wordless/releases/download/3.4.0/wordless_3.4.0_windows.zip)|1. Extract all files<br>2. Double-click **Wordless/Wordless.exe** to run
[Latest Release for macOS](https://github.com/BLKSerene/Wordless/releases/download/3.4.0/wordless_3.4.0_macos.zip)|1. Extract all files<br>2. Double-click **Wordless.app** to run
[Latest Release for Linux](https://github.com/BLKSerene/Wordless/releases/download/3.4.0/wordless_3.4.0_linux.tar.gz)|1. Extract all files<br>2. Double-click **Wordless/Wordless** to run<br>3. [Optional] Double-click **Wordless/Wordless - Create Shortucut** to create a shortcut in **Show Applications**
[Past Releases](https://github.com/BLKSerene/Wordless/releases)|Not recommended
[Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1--ZzABrDQBZlZagWlVQMbg?pwd=wdls#list/path=%2FWordless%2FWordless%203.4.0)|For Chinese users with unstable connections to Github (**PASSWORD: wdls**)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note 1:** It is recommended that the path to Wordless **not contain any non-ASCII chatacters, such as Chinese characters and letters with diacritics**.
> 
> **Note 2:** If your Mac says that **“Wordless” is damaged and can’t be opened**, please open **Terminal** (Launchpad → Other) and run:
> 
> <code>xattr -rc /Applications/Wordless.app</code><br>
> 
> remember to replace **/Applications/Wordless.app** with the actual path of Wordless on your computer (you could drag **Wordless.app** to the **Terminal**). Then, **run Wordless again** (the warning prompted in Terminal could be ignored if the program could be successfully opened).
> 
> **Note 3:** While opening corpora in languages other than English in *Wordless*, extra model files might need to be downloaded from the internet. If you encounter a **Network Error** dialog while downloading the model, chances are that it's a literal network error, so you just need to check your internet connections following the instructions in the error message and try downloading the model once more.
> 
> Users in China, where connections to Github and Hugging Face Hub are unstable, are recommended to use a proxy and set properly the settings in **Menu Bar → Preferences → Settings → General → Proxy Settings**. Alternatively, Chinese users can choose to manually download model files from [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1--ZzABrDQBZlZagWlVQMbg?pwd=wdls#list/path=%2FWordless%2Fmodels&parentPath=%2F). The steps of installing models are as follows:
> 
> 1. Check the error message displayed in the **Network Error** dialog. If **stanza** is found in the error message, you need a *Stanza* model, otherwise you need a *spaCy* model.
> 2. Download model files for the language of your corpus from the above link and **extract all files**.
> 3. For Windows and Linux users, put *spaCy* models under **Wordless/libs** and *Stanza* models under **Wordless/libs/stanza_resources**. For macOS users, right click on **Wordless.app**, select **Show Package Contents**, then put *spaCy* models under **Contents/Frameworks** and *Stanza* models under **Contents/Frameworks/stanza_resources**.
> 4. If your corpora are in different languages or both *spaCy* and *Stanza* models are required, repeat step 1 ~ 3 until the **Network Error** dialog disappears.
> 5. Try opening corpora in *Wordless* again, the model downloading process should be skipped now.
> 
> If the problem persists or the model you need is missing from the above link, please contact the author for further support.
